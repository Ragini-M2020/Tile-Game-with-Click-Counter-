Tile Game with Click Counter - A Fun DOM Manipulation Project.
"Tile Game with Click Counter." It's a fully interactive and engaging web-based game built using HTML and JavaScript. The project showcases my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design. The game consists of three tiles of different colors, each representing a distinct player's turn. The objective is to click on each tile, and on every click, the tile displays the number of times it has been clicked. Additionally, the project features a "Clear Score" button that resets the click counters to zero, providing users with a seamless experience
